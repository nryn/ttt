As a player,
So I can play noughts and crosses,
I would like to take turns to claim fields

As a player,
So I can get on with my life,
I would like the game to end once there is a winner or all spaces are filled.

As a player,
So I can trust the outcome of the game,
I would not want to be able to claim a field if it's already taken

As a player,
So I can play noughts and crosses,
I would like to be able to win once a row, column, or diagonal set of fields is taken
